# BadUSB-Files-for-Flipper-Zero
A big collection of Rubber Ducky BK Scripts.

Basically Plug-and-Play but some require a change or two to fully work.

There won't be any Exfiltration using methods NOT mentioned here: Discord-Webhook, USB

### IMPORTANT: BE RESPONSIBLE! NEVER TEST A HAZARDOUS SCRIPT ON PROPERTY THAT ISN'T YOURS! 

______________________________________________________________________________________________

## The Scripts are sorted by danger level or can be specified using the tags below: 

good (GOOD) = useful, might help with performance etc.

prank (PR) = little pranks to shock friends and confuse them

annoying (ANOY) = common things like permanent spam, scheduled shutdown etc.

setup (ST) = setup like port-opening and other stuff that might help with further exfiltration

exfiltration-without-harm (ENH) = data collection and potential outfiling

spy (SPY) = things like keylogger, long-term exfiltration etc.

deletion (DEL) = file deletion (yes... it's that simple..)

exfiltration-with-harm (EYH) = data collection with potential deletion of copied data 

destruction (PRAY) = messes with paths, filenames, important files 

massacre/death (GAMEOVER) = basically kills your PC (system32) or makes it unusable
______________________________________________________________________________________________

## The Scripts can also be specified by their duration*:
```
Instant (1-2 s)
Short-term (1-5 min)
Lingering (1-12 hours)
Long-term (1 day - forever)
```
______________________________________________________________________________________________

## Lastly i'll also add an estimated runtime to each description to make the usage more visible.

''Test''


*the duration of the outcome/effect of the script (e.g. spy = long-term/lingering)
